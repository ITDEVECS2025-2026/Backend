Autonomous Vehicle,"https://itdevecs2025-2026.github.io/Images-frontend/AutonomousVehicle(1).jpeg

","Designed and implemented an autonomous ground vehicle equipped with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) for motion sensing. The system features a localization algorithm to estimate the vehicle's position in real-time, a path planning module for route optimization, and a control system capable of executing directional commands such as left/right turns and braking. The vehicle is capable of navigating dynamic environments with minimal human intervention.",Researcher
